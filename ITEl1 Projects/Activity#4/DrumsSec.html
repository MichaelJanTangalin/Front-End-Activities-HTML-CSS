					TAMA's entry-level Rhythm Mate drum kit provides the precise bearing edges for easy tuning that beginners need and the <br>
					wide tuning range that pros demand. TAMA's original Accu-Tune Bass Drum Hoops offer faster, more consistent tuning <br>
					than traditional metal hoops. And if that wasn't enough, the hardware is equipped with double-braced legs for increased<br>
					stability. TAMA Rhythm Mate drums are changing the way entry-level kits are designed

					The Pearl Export EXX 8-piece drum kit's poplar and Asian mahogany shells are constructed using Pearl's proprietary Superior Shell Technology. <br>
					This construction method incorporates Pearl's trademarked AcoustiGlue that is boiled into the shells and pressed at over 1,000 lbs, <br>
					making the shell act and resonate as a single ply. SST uses precision-cut scarf joints to join the seams of the shells, offering over <br>
					800% more contact area than standard butt joints. This technology makes these drums so durable that they come with a limited lifetime <br>
					warranty from Pearl. And to make these shells sound even better, Pearl outfitted them with new lugs <br>	
					that minimize shell interaction for maximum resonance and sustain. That really impressed Sweetwater's picky drummers!
